## About

Included in this repository is a project that was carried out in May 2018. [Rijkswaterstaat](https://www.rijkswaterstaat.nl), the government organization responsible for all Dutch watersystems, made an enormous dataset of chemical compositions of water samples available. The project primarily contains an analysis of [chlorophyll A](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorophyll_a), as well as other chemicals that are closely related to it.

This project dispays a broad spectrum of data science skills. Data cleaning and significant amounts of preprocessing / data munging, as well as several forms of analysis, were the focus. Results are provided in the form of a report, found in the results folder. 

While the data that was used is not publically available, all my code can be found in this repository. Note the presence of an initial notebook containing some general-purpose data cleaning, followed by a significantly larger file containing preprocessing, data munging and visualizations. Lastly, a time series analysis was carried out in R. The output of all visualizations can be found in the img-folder. 

Code annotations are usually in English, however due to the nature of this project the report as well as the time series analysis are in Dutch.
